**Welcome to my Neural Network Library built from scratch.**
I really love to deeply understand how things works and I recently decided to get into Machine Learning and more precisely Deep Learning.

**What i brought me**
So coding my own neural network library like pytorch is so cool and instructive 
(i know its far from pytorch but  my nnl's goal is to make me able to create models without creating the whole neural network everytime, and at the same time knowing exactly what's happening)
*I will end up using pytorch or tensorflow but NNL is pretty cool.*
 - I was able to code a full object and make it all compact
 - My weights/biases/ouput matrices are dictionnary so i can store them for each layer
 - Made a backpropagation algorithm in one function (pretty happy about this one)
 - I learned to use git and github on different computers (pulling, branches, remote, all thoses basics things)
 - *I'm now tired because its 2am*

**Next ?**
I plan on upgrading and optimizing it.
Maybe next I'll implement CUDA for faster learning times, and I'll be able to use it for Image Recognition ??
Anyways, it is a very cool project that took me around 3 hours.
