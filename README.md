*Welcome to my built from scratch Neural Network Library.*
I really love to deeply understand how things works and I recently decided to get into Machine Learning and more precisely Deep Learning.
So coding my own neural network library like pytorch is so cool and instructive (i know its far from pytorch but  my nnl's goal is to make me able to create models without creating the whole neural network everytime, and at the same time knowing exactly what's happening)
I will end up using pytorch or tensorflow but NNL is pretty cool and I plan on upgrading it and optimizing it.
Maybe next I'll implement CUDA for faster learning times, and I'll be able to use it for Image Recognition ??
Anyways, it is a very cool project that took me around 3 hours.
